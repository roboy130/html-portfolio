<h1>The Best Movies According to Rohan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies with recent favorites</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Constant Gardener</h3>
<p>This one is an all time favorite. Very sad but a
    great love story.</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This is more a reminder to myseld that I need to watch
    Dune: Part 2. But Dune was amazing. One of the best movies I've seen in recent years.</p>
<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>I'm still partial to Christian Bale's batman but this movie
    was really well done. Kudos Robert Pattinson.</p>
