<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Rohan Hughes. Originally from the U.S. Virgin Islands, my family moved to Baltimore, Maryland 
  when I was 12 years old. I would go on to spend the majority of my life there, attending Baltimore Polytecnic Institute
  for high school and later graduating from Johns Hopkins University with a BA in English Literature.</p>

  <p>After spending a year overseas teaching English as Shandong Jiaotong University in Jinan, China, I returned to 
  Baltimore where I would go on to be an English teacher for the next 8 years. I spent a total of 4 years teaching
  middle school and another 4 teaching high school. I relished being able to connect with and support my
  students in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Though I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a teacher, after 8 years I decided that it was time for a change. 
  In September of 2023, I moved to San Francisco, California in order to pursue an MS in Computer Science
  at Northeastern University's Oakland Campus (formerly Mills College). I intend to graduate in April 2025,
  after which I wish to pursue a carer as a data scientist.
